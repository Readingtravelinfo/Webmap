<h2>Reading GIS Server</h2>
<h3>Personal Map Section</h3>
<p align="left">This area of the GIS server contains maps which are specific to individual users. These maps can only be seen by the user in question and admin users who may need access for support reasons.</p>
<p align="left">There are no links on this page as you can only see your own map, it is therefore recommended that you simply add your username to the URL at the top of this window to view your map.</p>
